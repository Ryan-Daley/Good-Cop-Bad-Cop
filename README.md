The Center for Policing Equity's Policing Dataset is a comprehensive collection of information on police stops, use of force, and other policing practices from police departments across the United States. The dataset is intended to be used to study patterns of policing behavior, including potential racial biases in policing.

This project involved extensive exploratory data analysis and data visualization to bring the dataset to light and examine policing practices. By analyzing the data and creating visual representations of it, I aimed to identify any patterns or trends in policing behavior that may be indicative of bias or discrimination.
